;BMON - THE BIG (BRIAN'S) MONITOR (2K VERSION TEC-1F)
;BY BRIAN CHIHA AND JIM ROBINSON
;
;THIS IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF JMON (JIM'S MONITOR).  IT KEEPS ALL THE GOOD THINGS OF
;THE MONITOR, LIKE AUTO INCREMENT, MENU AND PERIMETER HANDLERS, BREAK POINTS AND 
;SINGLE STEPPER.  WHAT HAS BEEN CHANGED IS THAT THE TAPE HANDLING ROUTINES HAVE BEEN
;REPLACED WITH 'BIT BANGED' SERIAL COMMUNICATION, A KEYBOARD MOD FEATURE AND ASCII
;BANNER FOR THE SEVEN SEGMENTS.
;
;BMON HAS BEEN WRITTEN FOR THE TEC-1F WITH INTERGRATED SERIAL COMMUNICATION.  THE CONCEPT
;IS THAT PROGRAMMING/DEBUGGING IS DONE ON AN EXTERNAL Z80 COMIPLER AND THE PROGRAM IS THEN 
;TRANSFERED TO THE TEC-1F VIA THE SERIAL COMMUNICATION PORT.  COMMUNICATION IS DONE 
;VIA BIT 7 OF THE KEYBOARD BUFFER (IN PORT 0) AND BIT 6 OF THE SEVEN SEGEMENT ACTIVE PORT (OUT PORT 1)
;
;TO ENTER THE FEATURES, PRESS "SHIFT-0" ON THE KEYPAD.  CHOOSE THE MENU ITEM BY PRESSING
;PLUS OR MINUS, THEN HIT GO TO RUN THE ROUTINE.  (HIT ADDRESS TO ESCAPE).  THE NEW MENU
;ITEMS ARE:
;
;SIO-IN - SERIAL INPUT.  SELECT START AND END ADDRESS TO LOAD FROM YOUR COMPUTER TO THE TEC
;SIO-OT - SERIAL OUTPUT. SELECT START AND END ADDRESS TO SEND TEC DATA TO YOUR COMPUTER
;INTEL - INTEL HEX FILE INPUT.  SEND AN INTEL HEX FILE FROM YOUR COMPUTER TO THE TEC
;ALTKEY - CHANGE BETWEEN STANDARD KEYBOARD LAYOUT OR MARK JELIC'S ALTERNATE KEYPAD LAYOUT
;BANNER - ASCII BANNER TICKER DISPLAY, SELECT A START ADDRESS AND A BANNER WILL BE DISPLAYED
;
;SO THAT THE ALTERNATE KEYBOARD WILL RETAIN ON A RESET, A HARD RESET WILL ONLY OCCUR ON 
;FIRST START UP AND WHEN THE RESET BUTTON IS PRESSED AT THE SAME TIME ANOTHER KEY IS PRESSED
;OTHERWISE ALL RESETS WILL BE SOFT AND RETAIN ANY USER SET UPS OR FLAGS.
;
;BIT BANG SERIAL ROUTINES 'TRANSMIT BYTE' AND 'RECEIVE BYTE' CAN BE CALLED EXTERNALLY BY
;DOING A CALL 004A AND CALL 004D.  SERIAL TRANSMISSION IS SET AT 4800-8-N-2
;
;THE FOLLOWING IS FROM THE JMON INSTRUCTIONS.
;
;GLOSSARY
;
;CURRENT EDITING LOCATION (082E)
;THIS IS THE ADDRESS THAT IS USUALLY DISPLAYED IN THE ADDRESS SECTION ON THE TEC LED
;DISPLAY. IT IS THE ADDRESS THAT IS SUBJECT TO MODIFICATION BY JMON.
;
;MONITOR CONTROL BYTE (MCB) (082B)
;THIS BYTE CONTAINS THE INFORMATION OF THE CURRENT WORKING STATE OF JMON. THE INFORMATION
;HELD IN THIS BYTE IS:
;1 - THE CURRENT MODE OF JMON.
;E.G. DATA, ADDRESS OR FUNCTION (NOT SHIFT AS SHIFT IS TESTED AND HANDLED DURING THE DATA
;KEY HANDLER ROUTINE). BITS 4 AND 5 ENCODE THE CURRENT MODE IN THE FOLLOWING WAY. BOTH
;BITS ARE LOW FOR THE DATA MODE, BIT 4 IS HIGH FOR THE ADDRESS MODE, BITS 4 AND 5 ARE HIGH
;FOR THE FUNCTION MODE. BIT 4 IS CALLED THE ADDRESS/FUNCTION BIT As THE SOFTWARE ONLY
;NEEDS TO TEST THIS BIT TO FIND IF EITHER THE ADDRESS OR FUNCTION MODE IS ACTIVE. BIT 5
;IS THE FUNCTION MODE ENABLED BIT.
;2 - THE NUMBER OF THE CURRENT FUNCTION I.E. 1,2 OR 3.
;THIS IS ENCODED IN BITS 2 AND 3. IF NO FUNCTION OR FUNCTION-1 IS ENABLED THEN BOTH BITS
;ARE LOW. IF FUNCTION-2 IS SELECTED THEN BIT 2 IS HIGH AND BIT 3 IS LOW. IF FUNCTION-3 IS
;SELECTED THEN BIT 3 IS HIGH AND BIT 2 IS LOW.
;3 - THE NUMBER OF NIBBLES ENTERED
;THIS IS ENCODED IN BITS 0 AND 1. IF NO NIBBLES HAVE BEEN ENTERED IN THE CURRENT EDITING
;LOCATION THEN BOTH BIT ARE LOW. IF ONE NIBBLE HAS BEEN ENTERED THEN BIT 0 IS HIGH AND
;BIT 1 IS LOW IS TWO NIBBLES HAVE BEEN ENTERED THEN BIT 0 IS LOW AND BIT 1 IS HIGH. JMON
;USES THESE BITS WHEN DECIDING ON THE AUTO-INCREMENT FEATURE. BITS 6 AND 7 ARE NOT USED.
;
;DISPLAY BUFFER ADDRESS - (082C/D)
;THE CONTENTS OF 082C/D POINTS TO THE LOCATION IN MEMORY OF THE 6 BYTE DISPLAY BUFFER
;(0800 FOR JMON AND 0806 FOR THE STEPPER). THE DISPLAY BUFFER ADDRESS POINTS TO THE LOWEST
;ADDRESS OF THE DISPLAY BUFFER WHICH CONTAINS THE LOW ORDER DATA DISPLAY BYTE.
;
;KEY PLANT
;THE KEY PLANT IS A FAKE KEY STROKE THAT MAY BE GENERATED BY THE "DURING SCAN/REY LOOP"
;USER PATCH. THE PLANT ALLOWS JMON'S MONITOR FUNCTIONS TO BE SOFTWARE CONTROLLED E.G. YOU
;MAY WISH TO VIEW THE CONTENTS ,OF MEMORY BYTE BY BYTE. WITH THE KEY PLANT YOU CAN SET JMON
;UP TO AUTOMATICALLY INCREMENT THE CURRENT EDIT LOCATION EVERY FEW SECONDS.
;THE PLANT IS IDENTIFIED BY THE USER PATCH STORING THE REQUIRED KEY VALUE IN, AND SETTING
;BIT 7 OF THE INPUT KEY BUFFER (0820).
;
;AUTO KEY STATUS BYTE (082A)
;THIS BYTE HOLDS THE INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR THE AUTO KEY REPEAT SECTION. THE INFORMATION
;HELD IN THIS BYTE IS EITHER ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
;A "NEXT KEY DETECTION WILL BE A FIRST DETECTION" SO JMON WILL PROCESS THE KEY IMMEDIATELY
;(BIT 7 HIGH) . A TIMER (BITS 0-6) THAT COUNTS, A DELAY FOR THE AUTO. REPEAT TIMING.
;
;KEY PRESS FLAG (0825)
;THIS FLAG IS USED TO REMEMBER IF THE ONE KEY PRESS HAS ALREADY BEEN DETECTED AND PROCESSED.
;THIS PREVENTS THE SAME KEY BEING PROCESSED EACH TIME THE SOFTWARE FINDS THAT IT IS PUSHED.
;THIS IS THE WAY IT WORKS:
;THE KEY PRESS FLAG 1S ZEROED BY THE JMON DEFAULT VARIABLES AND THIS FLAGS A "NO KEY
;PRESSED" STATE. WHEN A KEY IS DETECTED THEN THIS FLAG IS TESTED AND IF ZERO THEN THE KEY
;IS ACCEPTED AS A FIRST KEY PRESS. IN THIS CASE THE KEY PRESS FLAG IS THEN SET TO FF TO
;REMEMBER THAT THE KEY PRESS HAS BEEN DETECTED. IF A KEY IS DETECTED AND THIS FLAG BYTE
;IS NOT ZERO, THEN THE KEY IS IGNORED. WHEN THE SOFTWARE FINDS THAT NO KEY IS BEING PRESSED,
;THEN THIS FLAG IS CLEARED TO ALLOW THE NEXT KEY PRESS DETECTED TO BE PROCESSED.
;THIS FLAG IS USED BY THE RST 08, RST 10 RST 18 AND RST 20 KEYBOARD ROUTINES AS DESCRIBED
;IN ISSUE 15 TALKING ELECTRONICS AND ALSO THE STEPPER SOFTWARE.
;THE AUTO KEY REPEAT ROUTINE DOES NOT USE THIS FLAG BYTE, DO NOT CONFUSE THIS FLAG WITH
;THE AUTO KEY STATUS BYTE WHICH IS USED BY THE AUTO KEY REPEAT SECTION.
;
;"NEXT PC" BUFFER
;THIS IS A TEMPORARY PLACE TO SAVE THE RETURN ADDRESS WHICH IS THEN USED AS THE ACTUAL PC
;VALUE FOR THE NEXT INSTRUCTION STEPPED.
;
;FORCED HARD RESET
;THIS IS ACHIEVED BY HOLDING DOWN A KEY WHEN RELEASING THE RESET. THE HARD RESET CAUSES
;JMON TO RE-BOOT ITS VARIABLES AND ALSO MASK OFF ALL THE USER PATCHES (EXCEPT THE RESET
;PATCH). THE MAIN PURPOSE OF A FORCED HARD RESET IS TO RECOVER THE TEC IF A USER PATCH
;ENTERS A CONTINUOUS LOOP.

;ANOTHER DIFFERENCE IS THE ADDRESS OF THE ROUTINE TO BE EXECUTED ON A "GO" PRESS IS SUPPLIED
;BY THE CALLING ROUTINE. THEREFORE THE PERIMETER HANDLER DOESN'T REQUIRE A JUMP TABLE AND
;ASSOCIATED CALCULATER.
;THE ONLY OTHER MAJOR DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE PERIMETER HANDLER HAS ITS OWN BUILT IN DATA
;KEY HANDLER WHILE THE MENU DOES NOT.
;THE FRONT SECTION BELOW CALCULATES THE ADDRESS OF THE ACTIVE WINDOW AND THE ADDRESS OF

;IF THE "AD" KEY IS PRESSED, THEN THE RETURN ADDRESS IS POPPED OFF THE STACK AND A RETURN
;IS DONE TO THE CALLING ROUTINE (USUALLY JMON). IF THE "GO" KEY IS PRESSED, THEN THE ZERO
;FLAG WILL BE SET AND A RETURN DONE. IT IS THEN UP TO THE CALLING ROUTINE TO SERVICE THE
;"GO" KEY.
;A DATA KEY WILL BE FLAGGED BY SETTING THE CARRY FLAG AND CLEARING THE ZERO FLAG. LIKE
;THE "GO" KEY, THE CALLING ROUTINE MUST DECIDE WHAT IT IS TO DO WITH THE DATA KEY (THERE
;IS A BUILT IN DATA KEY HANDLER FOR THE PERIMETER HANDLER).
;IF EITHER THE "+" OR "-" KEYS ARE PRESSED THEN A SPECIAL ROUTINE IS CALLED. THIS ROUTINE
;WILL ALTER THE CURRENT NUMBER OF THE ACTIVE WINDOW OR MENU ENTRY. THE RESULT IS THAT WHEN
;THE DISPLAY IS UP-DATED, THE DISPLAYS WILL BE SHIFTED TO EITHER THE NEXT DISPLAY FOR "+"
;OR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE FOR "- " AND WRAP-AROUND IF REQUIRED.
