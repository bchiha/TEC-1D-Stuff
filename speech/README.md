# TEC Speech Module

Code and design for the TEC Speech board that uses the SP0256A-AL2 chip.  This chip is hard to find now and there are many fakes out there so ensure you have an original.  Some fakes are actually the SP0256-012 (Mattel Chip) and some crash the system.  I've include a picture of the original chip.  You can get them from http://www.sciencestore.co.uk/acatalog/Electronics.html


## Text 2 Allophone converter - text2allophone.c
Compile and run, then type some text.  Type **PP** to insert a 200ms pause and **EOF** to insert `0xFF` (End of file for TEC running program).  Control-D to exit.
**Note:** Puctuation must be seperated with a space or don't use it at all.

Output is given as Allophones and the SP0256a-AL2 hex equivilant.  If a word can't be found "**??**" is outputed and a "**.**" represents a word gap.  A pause of 100ms is automatically placed between words.

To be used with the TEC Speech Module attached to **Port 7**.

**Options**
|  |  |
|--|--|
|**-b**| Output Binary File which includes main program code |
| **-w** | Don't include main program in bianary file (used with -b) |
| **-w** | Don't include main program in bianary file (used with -b) |
| **-p** xx | Change the default output port where xx is the port number (used with -b> |
| **-d** | Output hex in z80 assmebler format using the DB directive |

For binary output to directly load into the TEC. use -b as a command line option.  Binary files are created with the code to activate the Speech Module and the speech data.  If you just want the allophones to be outputted use -w as well.  A new file is created after each Carriage Return.  Binary file are to be loaded at address `0x900` on the TEC.  If outputing a file the default port is 07H, this can be changed with the -p option.  If compiling the code locally, use the -d option that will translate the hex data into DB directive statements.

## Files that are requried are:

For reference, here is the Test Program that is used to run the Speech Module taking in data for the SP0256a-AL2 chip.  It is included in the binary output by default

    0900    21 0B 09    LD HL,090C      ;Location of allophone data
    0903    01 pp ss    LD BC,SIZE + PORT ;Load BC with length of allophone data and output port
    0906    ED B3       OTIR            ;Output Contents of HL, to port C, B times
    0908    76          HALT            ;Wait for key input as EOF has reached
    0909    18 F5       JR 0900         ;Jump back to start
    090B    <start of Allophone data>

    Note: SIZE (ss) and PORT (pp) are calculated at runtime based on inputs
